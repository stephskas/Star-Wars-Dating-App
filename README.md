### Usage:
User visits the app homepage and clicks a pulsing 'Match Me' button to find their intergalactic love match. 
Their match's image and attributes (Birth year, Hair color, Eye color, Height, Gender, Film Appearances, and Homeworld from API data) are displayed. 
The user can click on the Homeworld link to get more information about their match's homeworld (Climate, Terrain, Orbital Period, Population) to see if they would fit in. They can then navigate back to view their Match's profile or find a new match.
 
### Project Status:
Project is: complete and ready for review 

### Room for Improvement:
There are a limited number of images and characters. This could be expanded. Also the random selection of characters allows for selection of the same character on each click. Selected ids could be stored and filtered out so the same image can't be shown successively.
